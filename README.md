## Course Overview

Learn to develop LLM applications using the LangChain framework. Topics covered include:

1. Models, Prompts and Parsers: Calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response.
2. Memories for LLMs: Memories to store conversations and manage limited context space.
3. Chains: Creating sequences of operations.
4. Question Answering over Documents: Apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements.
5. Agents: Explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.

## Usage

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and follow the notebooks in sequence to learn LangChain application development.

## Original Course

Based on the DeepLearning.AI course taught by Andrew Ng and Harrison Chase, creator of LangChain. Find the original course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/projects/langchain-for-llm-application-development-project).
